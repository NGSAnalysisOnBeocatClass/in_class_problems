##Code Challenge X

This exercise can be tested and completed at http://rosalind.info/problems/dna/

A string is simply an ordered collection of symbols selected from some alphabet and formed into a word; the length of a string is the number of symbols that it contains.

An example of a length 21 DNA string (whose alphabet contains the symbols 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T') is "ATGCTTCAGAAAGGTCTTACG."

Given: A DNA string s of length at most 1000 nt.

Return: Four integers (separated by spaces) counting the respective number of times that the symbols 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T' occur in s.

Sample Dataset

```
AGCTTTTCATTCTGACTGCAACGGGCAATATGTCTCTGTGTGGATTAAAAAAAGAGTGTCTGATAGCAGC
```

Sample Output

```
20 12 17 21
```

###Once your script works on the sample dataset go to Rosalind and run your program on a test dataset. Upload a screenshot of your "Correct!" notification from Rosalind to KSOL with the filename "CCX".
